NO - Use stash strategy instead:

1. Stash my local changes:
   git stash push -m "Local async components work"

2. Pull remote updates:
   git pull origin main

3. Reapply my changes:
   git stash pop

4. If conflicts appear, I'll resolve them manually.

This protects my local work while getting remote updates.
